bad news!

I submit the next version last night 4/15/2016.
But today, I was told to remove this from AppleStore because of the owner of the apple developer account.

So, may be you will see it in AppleStore again once i have my own apple developer account.
For a very simple reason, i was too poor to afford a account with ï¿¥688 a year.
For me, it is too expensive now.
So, from now on, may be  i'm the only person who use this app.
If you have interest in this, you can clone it and build it and run it in your iDevice.

Sometimes I may forget to upgrade it to adapt to the changes of the website which this app use.
you can open an issue to remind me.
It couldn't be better to pull a request to get all this things done.

Anyway, welcome to contribute!
And you can also submit to AppleStore, just give me link to it.
So, I can update this README quickly.
